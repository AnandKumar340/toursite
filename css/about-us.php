                    	MiddleEast Asia Routes is an heart-winning adventure travel company, founded in 2006 by Tour Leader and Travel Planner Sumit Pruthi. We specialise in stylish and original small group tours and tailor-made holidays worldwide. We are firm believers that travelling is all about the experience and it’s in the details – the places you stay, the transport and route that gets you there, and the people you meet along the way – that make the trip; we therefore specialise in drawing on our own extensive local knowledge and array of contacts to give our clients the very best experience possible.

I always had a dream to travel with travelers instead of tourists.After traveling in to many countries and leading numbers of trips for many American, Canadians and Germans companies I and my other four companion tour leaders decided to work on our dream,that was to plan the Routes for true travelers.
